## Description
The Crystal-Clicker-Game is a randomized number guessing game. The user will be given a goal number to reach and four crystals with randomized values to use to reach the goal number. If the user surpasses the goal number, they lose.

## Motivation
This game was created as part of the University of Richmond Full Stack Flex Web Development program curriculum to further JavaScript skills. It is useful in practicing basic JS skills and furthering jQuery skills.

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery Library
This game was created by making a simple HTML and CSS file then adding in a JavaScript file. Each changing number is a variable on the JS file with some being a span on the HTML file. Functions are included to make the code work, then conditionals (if/then statements) are used to ensure the correct action happens (alert for wins and game refresh for losses). jQuery library is used to shorten the number of lines of code that would've been filled with JavaScript.
